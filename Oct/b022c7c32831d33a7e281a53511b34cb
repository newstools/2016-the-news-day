German ZDF public television's director-general Thomas Bellut said Tuesday's dropping of a charge of insulting a head of state - decided by prosecutors in Mainz, where the channel is based - was "good news" for artistic freedom in Germany.B hmermann's lawyer Daniel Krause said the prosecutors had withstood extensive political pressure and their decision "deserved emphasis and respect."'Good news' for freedoms, says ZDF's BellutB hmermann tweeted he would wait until Wednesday&nbsp;to comment.Still pending in Hamburg is a final ruling in a civil case in which Erdogan wants a ban on the "defamatory poem."&nbsp;The satirist recited the poem during a late Thursday evening broadcast on March 31 to test literary freedoms -&nbsp;just as Germany was embroiled in talks&nbsp;with Turkey on a deal to stem refugee movements into Europe.ZDF promptly withdrew the item from its online archive but copies still circulated.Redress sought under rarely used law&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erdogan personally filed the charge in April, seeking&nbsp;redress under section 103 of Germany's criminal code for insulting a head of state, which&nbsp;prosecutors can only pursue at the request of the German government.Chancellor Angela Merkel later expressed regret at her government's approval of the probe while also announcing that Berlin would scrap the archaic passage.Making up at the G20 in SeptemberShe also expressed concern about clamps on&nbsp;the media in Turkey.Oversensitive autocrat?The German Justice Ministry declined immediate comment on Tuesday's outcome.But, the chairman of the German DJV journalists' trade union Frank berall said: "This clearly means that in Germany satirical freedom has a higher status than the sensitivity of an autocrat about his reputation."Opposition Left party foreign affairs spokesperson Sevim&nbsp;Dagdelen said the Mainz prosecutors had defended artistic and press freedoms in Germany "against Turkish President Erdogan, an avowed enemy of press freedoms."
