In a statement, the Raif Badawi Foundation said it had received the confirmation from the same source that had notified his family and associates about the first set of 50 lashes, which were served on January 9, 2015. The foundation did not specify who the source was.In contrast to the first round of punishment, which was performed in a public place, the next&nbsp;lashing was reportedly due to be carried out inside prison. Following injuries after his first flogging, Badawi's remaining 950 lashes had to be&nbsp;postponed indefinitely.The foundation said it had called on the Saudi government and royal family to intervene and stop the punishment. It has also asked the government to pardon Badawi and to deprive him of his Saudi citizenship, so he could be reunited with his family, who reside in Canada where they were granted asylum.
