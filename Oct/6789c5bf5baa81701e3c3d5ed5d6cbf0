Martin finished&nbsp;in 44 minutes 42&nbsp;seconds, 45 seconds ahead of Kiryienka.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spain's Jonathan&nbsp;Castroviejo completed the podium in third place but was over a minute down on Martin.The 31-year-old German won his previous titles between 2011 and 2013 and joins Swiss rider&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabio Cancellara (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010) in winning&nbsp;four time trial world titles. Martin overcame temperatures of up to 40 degrees as a number of cyclists&nbsp;struggled in Doha, which was controversially chosen to hold the event.The win is a high in an otherwise disappointing season for Martin. The Etixx-Quick-Step rider had to retire injured from the Tour de France and finished 12th while riding for his country in the Olympics."This title makes up for everything that has happened this year. Deep&nbsp;inside me I knew I could become world champion. This gives&nbsp;me a lot&nbsp;of motivation for 2017," he said after his victory.In fact, it was the Olympic result that prompted Martin to return to time trials. His win also helped Etixx claim the team time trial in Doha&nbsp;at the weekend.mp (Reuters/DPA)
