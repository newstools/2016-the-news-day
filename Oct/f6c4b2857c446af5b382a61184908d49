Margot K ssmann, the former head of Germany's Protestant Church, told German media on Wednesday that she had no intention of running for federal president."I am honored to be named in connection with the highest office in the country, but I am not available for this position," K ssmann&nbsp;told the "Berliner Zeitung" and "Passauer Neuen Presse" newspapers.Earlier on Wednesday, reports surfaced that the Social Democrats (SPD), the Left Party and the Greens were considering her as a candidate for&nbsp;the next president.&nbsp;Left Party chairman Bernd Riexinger confirmed to the "Berliner Zeitung" that SPD&nbsp;chief and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel had held talks with both the Left and the Greens about the possibility of backing a common candidate."We want a candidate who is open-minded and stands for social justice and a peaceful foreign policy - Ms K mann would meet [this requirement], without doubt," Riexinger said.K ssmann, a Lutheran theologian, was previously Bishop of the Protestant-Lutheran Church of Hanover. In 2009, she was elected to&nbsp;lead&nbsp;the German Protestant Church, but stepped down four months later after driving&nbsp;through a red light whilst&nbsp;under the influence of alcohol.
