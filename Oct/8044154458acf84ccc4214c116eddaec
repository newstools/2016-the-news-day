According to German police, two men in the German town of Wesel were left shaken over the weekend after they were approached at a train station by an armed man disguised as a clown.The clown, who was reportedly carrying a knife and a gun, threatened the 17- and 22-year-old men in German and English.The incident on Saturday night is thought to have been influenced by the "creepy clown" trend in the US which sees pranksters dressing up as scary clowns in a bid to frighten members of the public. The clowns have often been sighted lurking close to woodland, grave yards and remote streets.
