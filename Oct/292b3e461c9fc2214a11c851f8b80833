Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al&nbsp;Ahmad al&nbsp;Sabah dissolved parliament on Sunday, citing a "lack of cooperation" between the country's branches of government,&nbsp;the official KUNA state news agency reported."Due to the delicate regional developments and the need to face the dangers of security challenges, it became necessary to go back to the people ... to elect their representatives ... and contribute to confronting those challenges," he said in a decree.The tiny Gulf State's Cabinet resigned as well on Sunday, reported state media.The announcement followed an emergency government meeting and came less than 24 hours after parliament speaker Marzouk al-Ghanem called for snap elections.Lawmakers recently filed three requests to question the nation's ministers over a decision to raise petrol prices and over alleged financial and administrative violations.Although a date has not yet been set for the new elections, the polls must take place within two months of the dissolution of the house&nbsp;according to Kuwait's constitution.Kuwait is a major oil producer and strong US&nbsp;ally. The nation last held parliamentary elections in 2013. Some opposition and Islamist groups boycotted the race for the 50-seat legislative body.rs/jlw&nbsp;(AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
