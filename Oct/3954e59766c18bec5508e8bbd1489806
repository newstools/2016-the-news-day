Several German newspapers belonging to the "Funke Media Group" reported on Wednesday that Social Democrat (SPD) chief and Vice Chancellor&nbsp;Sigmar Gabriel wants to see Margot K mann become a candidate for the German presidency.According to Wednesday's reports, K mann is yet to confirm whether she wants to stand as a candidate to become Germany's&nbsp;12th post-war president.&nbsp;Gabriel, however, has reportedly asked for a second meeting with K mann to discuss her candidacy further.K mann, a Lutheran theologian was previously Bishop of the Protestant-Lutheran Church of Hanover. In 2009, she was elected to&nbsp;lead&nbsp;the German Protestant Church, but stepped down four months later after driving&nbsp;through a red light whilst driving under the influence of alcohol.

It's comprised in equal parts of the Bundestag parliamentary delegates and representatives from Germany's sixteen federal states -&nbsp;thereby reflecting&nbsp;the relative strengths of Germany's political parties both nationwide and locally.Gauck's successor is due to be elected by Germany's Federal Assembly on February 12, 2017.&nbsp;Merkel had originally hoped that he would serve a second term, but the 76-year-old announced in&nbsp;June that he would not run for a second term as head of state.Gauck, a former Lutheran pastor,&nbsp;said&nbsp;he was worried about his ability to continue devoting enough energy to the job if he continued into his eighties.Although the German president is nominally the head of state, aside from certain constitutional duties, his function is largely ceremonial.
