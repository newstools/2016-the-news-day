However, I will try and bring my own style of play to the team."G ndogan has made a strong start to life in EnglandA long road to recoveryG ndogan's injury troubles have been well-known&nbsp;since&nbsp;his time with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga. He missed over 100 matches through injury during his time with Dortmund and&nbsp;the start to his career in England was also delayed by a knee injury.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the midfielder never lost courage and belief that he would make a return to football."When you are out for as long as I was, you start to question whether you will ever be able to play at the same level and if you will ever return to full fitness," G ndogan, who was also out for over one year between 2013 and 2014 with spinal issues, explained."But I never lost my courage or belief and knew that I could come back from it."The 25-year old has expressed a desire to enjoy the moment, should he be called upon by Joachim L w in Hamburg at the weekend. G ndogan has enjoyed every moment of his start with Manchester City having already scored his first goal for the club."For me, the Premier League is the strongest league in the world," G ndogan said. "It is extremely demanding and so is Pep Guardiola. When you listen to what he has to say, you realize he is a world class coach."&nbsp;&nbsp;
