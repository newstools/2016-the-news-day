A regional governor said Thursday that security forces in the Mandera region near the Somali border had fought off Islamist militants at a residential compound, leading to at least six casualties.That region has often been targeted by al-Shabab, which says it will continue its campaign&nbsp;of attacks in Kenya until the Kenyan government withdraws its troops from Somalia, where they are part of a multinational African force."If not for the quick response by our security forces, we would be talking of many more&nbsp;casualties now," the governor of Mandera county, Ali&nbsp;Roba, told Reuters by telephone. "From the nature and style of the attack, it will obviously be al-Shabab."&nbsp;The Daily Nation, a leading Kenyan news site, reported that the attack occurred early in the morning at a public works site. That information has not been confirmed.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.But repeated attacks by al-Shabab in Kenya&nbsp;have killed hundreds and threatened the east African country's tourism industry. Most of the assaults have been in the northeast, near the long&nbsp;and porous border with Somalia, but the group has also struck coastal areas popular with tourists and the capital, Nairobi, where al-Shabab gunmen attacked Westgate Shopping Mall in 2013.jar/kl (Reuters, AFP)
