The European Union has given Brussels a deadline to reach an agreement about the free trade deal with Canada. The Belgian region of Wallonia has rejected the ultimatum, arguing the deal hurts European interests. (23.10.2016) The European Union's hopes of signing a free trade deal with Canada later this week faded away on Monday when the Belgian government failed to get the necessary backing for the free trade deal with Canada."We are not in a position to sign CETA," Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said after talks with Belgium's regional leaders in Brussels.The talks broke up without an agreement after Wallonia, the Brussels city government and the French community rejected the deal.The head of Wallonia's parliament said earlier on Monday the region would not yield to an ultimatum set by the EU for it to decide on a pact known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).&nbsp;Andre Antoine, Walloon parliamentary president and a member of Belgium's center-left Socialist party, said his region is not giving way."There's a huge mish-mash of texts. This is not serious international law," Antoine said. "Secondly, ultimatums and threats are not part of democracy. We want a deal, we want a treaty, but we want to negotiate it with a minimum of courtesy and respect."

European Parliament President Martin Schulz has said he is&nbsp;"very optimistic" that the deal can be salvaged.At least 8,000 anti-CETA protesters that included young people, farmers, union leaders, and entrepreneurs joined a Saturday rally in Amsterdam in a show of solidarity.&nbsp;Many Walloons - who have a robust agricultural economy - have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada.If CETA fails, the EU's hopes of completing similar deals with the United States or Japan could be in jeopardy.rs, jar/kl (Reuters, AP)
