European illicit drug use is one thing that doesn't change fast. Cannabis is still the drug of choice and the number of new psychoactive substances grows each year. But one drug is making a comeback. (31.05.2016) The number of smokers, especially among children and teenagers in Germany, has dropped, according to the government's latest drug report. But the number of first-time users of harder drugs has risen. (21.05.2015) Australian authorities seized 1.2 tons of the illicit party drug ecstasy this month in Sydney, officials announced Saturday. The largest drug haul so far this year was made after about 4.5 million tablets containing the&nbsp;drug crystal Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) was found concealed inside in a shipment of metal from the Czech Republic following a tip-off to police."The goods were declared as aluminum rolls and within the aluminum rolls there was a number of lead casings that concealed the actual narcotics themselves, so it's a very sophisticated concealment," Border Force Commander Tim Fitzgerald told reporters.Two Polish men, aged 28 and 29, were arrested and charged for allegedly importing the drugs. They were denied bail at a hearing held at Parramatta Local Court on Saturday.Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the seizure was one for the record books:&nbsp;"This is the largest drug haul in Australia so far in 2016 and the fourth-largest ecstasy seizure on record," he said.Investigations by police and Australian customs are continuing and further arrests are anticipated, authorities said, adding that the smugglers had used a very advanced technique to hide the drugs, which suggested a sophisticated criminal operation.Related to amphetamines, MDMA can cause a surge in euphoria and increase&nbsp;energy,&nbsp;making it a popular recreational stimulant, especially&nbsp;in dance clubs.&nbsp;jar/kl&nbsp;(AFP, dpa, Reuters)
