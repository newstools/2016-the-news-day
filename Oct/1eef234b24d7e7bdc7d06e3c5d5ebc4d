They also criticized the institute for withholding data by using privacy protection in a "disproportionate and unfounded" manner.The alleged protection of privacy "amounted to a form of censorship," the NGO activists said.While the site creators encountered "diverse problems and barriers that appeared to be technical," behind them there were "clear intentions to obstruct and undermine the project," they added.Nursery fire blacked outThe autonomous body was also under fire for deciding to withhold a trove of documents just days before the website went online.
