Dodi Suridi was found guilty on Thursday of committing an act of terror by helping to make a bomb used in the deadly attack on the Indonesian capital earlier this year.The 23-year-old supporter of the group calling itself the&nbsp;"Islamic State" (IS) showed little no remorse as he was jailed for 10 years, telling the court: "That's the risk of being a terrorist, I accept the verdict."A second IS supporter, 48-year-old Ali Hamka, was also jailed for four years over the attack, for trying to find guns and ammunition to use in the assault.Roughly 40 militants have been detained in connection with the January 14 attack, which began with a suicide bombing inside a Starbucks cafe and then saw a gun battle between security forces and IS militants.Prosecutors said Suridi altered a gas canister to be used an explosive device by another man, who blew himself up.&nbsp;He knew a suicide bombing would take place but was not informed of the location or date. He also participated in meetings aimed at recruiting suicide bombers, they said.The Jakarta attack saw security forces clash with Islamist militants in the center of the Indonesian capitalAnalysts believe a jailed pro-IS cleric was behind the attack, the first claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. The assault came amid concerns that the Islamist militant group may be expanding its support in the region.Indonesia suffered several deadly bombings at the beginning of the century, including attacks on Jakarta and Bali blamed on Islamist extremists.But the world's most populous Muslim-majority country has, so far, seen just a small minority of fighters sign up to travel to the Middle East to fight for IS in the territory it's calling a "caliphate."Also on Thursday, a man carrying an IS symbol was fatally shot after attacking police on the outskirts of Jakarta with a machete and pipe bombs.&nbsp;Three police officers were injured in the attack in Tangerang.&nbsp; The bombs failed to explode.The man, identified as 21-year-old Sultan Aziansyah, died on the way to hospital from bullet wounds to his legs and stomach, a police spokesman said.mm/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)
