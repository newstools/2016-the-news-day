ORGANISERS of South African RnB superstar, Toya Delazy s show, Sound Event Management, were left red faced after it turned into a monumental flop, attracting a paltry crowd at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) on Friday. BY KENNEDY NYAVAYAIt is uncertain what caused the poor turnout, but change of venue from Borrowdale Racecourse to HICC at short notice could have contributed.The initial venue was ruled out a few days before the show, throwing the organisers into a quandary before they opted for a venue that appeared less attractive for their targeted audience.The upper deck of the venue was literally empty, while downstairs, most artistes and technical crews could be seen along with a small number of youthful fans.Although the programme was delayed by about an hour, local artistes, who shared the stage with Toya Delazy, managed to rise to the occasion, as they put up polished performances.After winning a slot in an online competition to be part of the performers on the night, local hip-hop rapper, Sharky staged, a convincing performance, while the rising Tammy Moyo also had a good set, as she dominated the stage like a mature artiste, performing with a live band.The most sought-after female artiste in the country, Ammara Brown proved why she is a force to reckon with. With her angelic voice coupled with breathtaking gyrations, Ammara Brown stole the show, leaving many clamouring for more of her music.The best part of her set was when she invited her sibling Chengeto for collaboration off their late father s Andy hit song Mapurisa, sending fans into delirium.She capped her performance with the popular song Mukoko, in which she was featured by Tytan, before she made way for the main artiste, who performed just a few minutes after midnight.As a headline act, Toya Delazy successfully carried out her duty of Rocking the City, the theme for her ongoing tour of southern African cities.Her performance, which lasted for over an hour, seemed to have mesmerised the crowd, although many of the fans did not know the lyrics of some of her songs.In an interview with NewsDay soon after her performance, Toya Delazy said she was not worried about the low turnout, as she was content with the positive reception during her performance. I think tonight (Friday) was fantastic, as you can see we are embracing each other. This show was just on an upper level because you could see that even if the fans did not know some of the lyrics to the songs they just appreciated, she said.The 26-year-old Toya Delazy was staging her third performance in Zimbabwe, as part of her Rocking the City tour of African cities, which will see her performing 20 shows in seven countries over seven weeks.
