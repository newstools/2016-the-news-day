Gibraltar 0 - Belgium 6(Benteke 1', 43' 55', Witsel 19', Mertens 51' Eden Hazard 79')There was no doubt that Belgian striker Christian Benteke's goal, which came almost immediately after Gilbraltar kicked off on Monday night was fast, but there was some question about just how fast it actually was, with the world governing body FIFA initially saying it was scored "inside seven seconds." It later revised the figure to 8.1 seconds, still the "fastest goal ever recorded in an international match." Benteke went on two score two more to complete his hat trick for Belgium, who are top of Group H on goal difference.Netherlands 0 - France 1(Pogba 30')The Netherlands, who failed to qualify for last summer's European championship, suffered a 1-0 loss at home to France, to leave them in third place in Group A.&nbsp; Manchester United's record summer signing Paul Pogba (pictured above)&nbsp;sealed the win for the visitors with a powerful first-half strike from 30 meters (32 yards) out, however Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg should have done better on that one."Maarten knows that he would usually save that with one hand in training," Netherlands coach Danny Blind said afterwards.Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris came up with a save late in the game to preserve the three points for France, who lead Group A on goal difference. This was the first time in 16 years that the Dutch have been defeated at home in World Cup qualifying.While it's still early in the competition, the Netherlands' aspirations of&nbsp;advancing to the World Cup in Russia&nbsp;now look to be very much in jeopardy, as only the nine group winners will qualify directly, with four runners-up to qualify through a playoff round.Faroe Islands 0 - Portugal 6 (Silva 12', 22' 37', Ronaldo 65', Moutinho 90' +1, Cancelo 90' + 3)Playing in just his fourth international, 20-year-old Andre Silva scored a hat trick and Cristiano Ronaldo was held to just one of Portugal's six goals.
