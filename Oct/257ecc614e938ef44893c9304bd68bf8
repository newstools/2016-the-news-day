The head of Peru's Nationalist Party and wife of the president, Nadine Heredia is being investigated for suspected money laundering. The funds were allegedly used to finance President Ollanta Humala's election campaign. (26.09.2015) Pedro Kuczynski has been inaugurated as Peru's new president. The former Wall Street banker said he plans to kick-start Peru's economy and combat poverty. (28.07.2016) Prosecutor German Juarez said Monday that a criminal investigation was widening to include Humala, the former president, as part of a scheme run by his wife Nadine Heredia that involved embezzling political party funds and laundering money between 2006 and 2011.Much of the prosecution's case centers on four notebooks attributed to the former first lady which were turned over by former Nationalist Party members. The ledgers include detailed information about transactions in the millions - including names and dates - that suggest the pair funneled campaign donations into personal bank accounts.Prosecutors have dismissed a criminal complaint against the former president that alleges he took kick backs from illegal mining and public funds from Venezuela to finance his 2006 and 2011 election campaigns.His wife is already banned from traveling abroad. Both claim they are the victims of persecution by their political enemies and deny any illegal activity.jar/kl (dpa, EFE)&nbsp;
