The Turkish government has accused G len of ordering July's coup attempt. G len has repeatedly denied the charges.The accused include members of the justice ministry, as well as judges working at the Court of Cassation, Turkey's top court of appeals, and the Council of State, the nation's highest administrative court, according to the Anadolu news agency.The 'G len App'Authorities accused the judges and prosecutors based on their alleged use of a smart phone encrypted messaging app called ByLock, the news agency reported.The Turkish government claims G len followers used the app to coordinate the coup attempt and to share secret messages. The country's National Intelligence Organization (MIT) began to decrypt messages sent on the app after&nbsp;May 2015, officials have said.The government then used information gathered from the app to identify tens of thousands of G len followers after the coup. Authorities have detained hundreds of government officials and police this week due to their alleged use of the messaging app.On Thursday, the Education Ministry removed 2,400 teachers from their posts as a result of the post-coup investigation, Anadolu reported. Turkey's Defense Ministry said on Thursday it dismissed 109 military judges.Around 32,000 people have been arrested pending trial over alleged ties to the coup while around 100,000 people have been dismissed or suspended from government positions.The purges have been carried out under a state of emergency which was extended for another 12 weeks this month. Critics say the purges ignore due process and have led to the arrests or dismissals of innocent people&nbsp;as well.rs/jm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)&nbsp;
