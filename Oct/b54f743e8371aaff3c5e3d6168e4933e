A number of German media organizations reported on Monday that coach L w has&nbsp;signed a contract extension with the German football association (DFB), which would keep him at the helm of the national team until 2020. The DFB has called a press conference&nbsp;featuring L w and association president Reinhard Grindel in which they are expected to officially announce the move.The extension would mean that L w would lead the team into the 2020 European championship, a title that has so far eluded the 56-year-old coach. At Euro 2016 in France last summer, Germany stumbled at the second-to-last hurdle, losing 2-0 to the host nation in their semifinal in Marseille. In 2008, L w guided Germany to the final of the European Championship, when they were defeated 1-0 by Spain.The national team is&nbsp;currently attempting to&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for the 2018&nbsp;World Cup&nbsp;in Russia,&nbsp;where&nbsp;they will be aiming to defend the title they won in Brazil two years ago. Germany lead World Cup qualifying Group C with perfect record&nbsp;following wins over Norway, the Czech Republic and Northern Ireland. Their next qualifier is against San Marino on November 11.pfd/dv (dpa, SID)&nbsp;
