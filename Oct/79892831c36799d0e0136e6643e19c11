The United Nations Security Council began discussions on a new draft resolution on Monday in a desperate bid to&nbsp;end&nbsp;fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo.The US on Monday suspended negotiations with Russia on reviving the stalled ceasefire in Syria and on cooperating militarily to target jihadis in the country. (03.10.2016) The city's dire humanitarian crisis has been compounded by government shelling in the rebel-held east. On top of the hospital attack, Human Rights Watch has accused President Assad of using banned chemical weapons. (28.09.2016) The Turkish military says at least 15 Syrian rebels fighting with Turkish troops have been killed by mines laid by 'IS' militants. Turkey is engaged in an operation to clear Syrian border regions of the jihadists. (03.10.2016) Russia is sending more warplanes to Syria to bolster its air campaign, according to reports. Earlier, Moscow dismissed allegations that attributed more than 3,800 civilian deaths in Syria to Russian attacks. (01.10.2016) The UK and France have accused Russia of possible war crimes as the Syrian army-led offensive entered its fourth day. Thousands of civilians remain trapped in Aleppo amid a brutal campaign to uproot rebels in the city. (26.09.2016) The proposal, drafted by France, calls&nbsp;for a UN-led task force&nbsp;to monitor a&nbsp;truce and threatened "further measures" should any party to the conflict violate it."We consider that this is our responsibility to do absolutely everything we can do, everything humanly possible to unite the Security Council behind our efforts to end the martyrdom in Aleppo," said France's ambassador to the UN, Francois Delattre, before the Security Council meeting.A US-Russia brokered ceasefire between government forces and moderate rebels that had given nearly a week&nbsp;reprieve to spiralling violence, but since it broke down Syrian allied forces have pushed a major offensive on the encircled rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo.The aftermath of the ceasefire breakdown&nbsp;has seen Russia and the West trading accusations, as a&nbsp;humanitarian crisis in Aleppo deepens. &nbsp;The US-Russia spat, which included accusations against Moscow of war crimes for its bombing raids, culminated with the&nbsp;US suspending its Syria cooperation with Moscow on Monday. Russia has insisted it had to resume its bombing campaign to prevent terrorists from taking over Aleppo.

Western and Gulf backed rebels are intermingled and operate in the same area as the Levant Conquest Front.On top of blocking supply routes, the non-stop bombardment of rebel-held eastern&nbsp;Aleppo has also damaged local water supplies and hospitals.&nbsp;More than 300,000&nbsp;people have died since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011.es/cw/cmk (AFP, Reuters)
