Germany 3-0 Czech RepublicMuller 13', 65' Kroos 49'Thomas M ller scored another brace for his country as Germany eased to a 3-0 win over the Czech Republic in Hamburg.The Bayern Munich forward gave Germany the lead early on with a neat finish after good work by Mario G tze and Mesut zil.Toni Kroos made it 2-0 shortly after the break with a superb finish from distance, and M ller got his second midway through the second half, wrapping up the win with a close-range finish.Coach Joachim L w demanded a stronger attacking performance from his side, with a shyness in front of goal ultimately costing them at the European Championship.But there were no such problems on a cold Saturday night at the Volksparkstadion, with a near full-strength Germany causing a timid Czech Republic side problems from the start.Germany opened the scoring in the 13th minute after a slick move including three of their brightest players on the night. G tze's dangerous run had the visitors' defence stretched, he found zil who helped the ball onto M ller to finish well into the bottom corner.It was M ller's first goal in nearly a month, and there were others that felt they could get on the scoresheet. Julian Draxler enjoyed a lively game and almost doubled Germany's lead when he bent a shot a whisker wide of the post after G tze had found him.&nbsp;With the second half barely five minutes old, Germany moved 2-0 up and it was a beautiful finish by Toni Kroos from outside the box. Joshua Kimmich, who started at right-back again after his goal-scoring international debut against Norway last month, created the chance with a driving run and cross from the right, and Kroos delicately guided the ball into the bottom corner with a first-time shot.Czech Republic struggled to trouble Germany at all on the night, with Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels reunited in central defence on a quiet night for the German defence.The victory was not in doubt after the second, but M ller added a third to notch up another win for L w's side, stabbing in from close-range after zil and Hector combined.Germany host Northern Ireland in Hanover on Tuesday night as they look to maintain their 100 percent&nbsp;start to World Cup 2018 qualifying.
