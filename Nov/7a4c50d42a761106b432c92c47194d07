Amasi follows the pair through their struggles, ending with the father and son duo recording a new song.Amasi said the documentary generated an emotional response at its screening at the London Picture House and in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, early this year. The documentary, You Can t Hide From The Truth, is a pitiful film about a father and son struggling to make ends meet in Zimbabwe s music industry. The duo is seen busking to large audiences, playing great music, but never receive any tips for their efforts, Amasi said. Realising the problems of Zimbabwe s economic and political situation without precisely referring to them, You Can t Hide From The Truth, shows a national situation through the most intimate of approaches. Gonora, who was part of Zimbabwe s largest touring group, Jairos Jiri Band about 20 years ago, plies his trade on the streets of Harare with his young gifted son Isaac on makeshift drums. With the aid of well-wishers, Gonora managed to record his debut album Wawacha, which was nominated in the sungura category of the 2014 Zimbabwe Music Awards.
