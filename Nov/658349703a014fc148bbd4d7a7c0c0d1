National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe leader, Standrick Zvorwadza yesterday applied for discharge at the close of the State case when he appeared before Harare magistrate, Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro, during his disorderly conduct trial. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEIn his application, Zvorwadza said the State had failed to prove a prima facie case against him mainly because the charges were politically motivated.However, the State opposed the application arguing Zvorwadza did not challenge the submissions by the investigation officer, Tanyanyiwa Mangena, who alleged that he disturbed public peace by gathering without permission from the authority.Prosecutor Progress Maringamoyo said Zvorwadza was arrested at the scene of the crime and there was enough evidence against him.Maringamoyo further urged the court to dismiss Zvorwadza s application and put him to his defence instead. The matter was remanded to Monday for ruling.According to the State, on January 9, 2013 and at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) vehicle theft squad, Southerton in Harare, Zvorwadza allegedly insulted and threatened a police officer who was on duty.Zvorwadza is alleged to have said to Mangena: If you are a bouncer, go to Police General Headquarters and arrest Deputy Commissioner-General (Operations) (Innocent) Matibiri for selling my vehicle. The State alleged the words uttered by Zvorwadza were intended at provoking the breach of peace.
