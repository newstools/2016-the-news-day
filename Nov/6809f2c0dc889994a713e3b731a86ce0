ONE feature that every currency, whether Indian, South African or American, needs to have, as a matter of record, is trust of the people. guest column: LEARNMORE ZUZEIt is trite to say that a currency cannot enjoy stability if the people, who ought to use it as legal tender, have no confidence in it.This, aptly, is one of the fundamental challenges staring at the bond notes set to become legal tender in a few weeks time.The confidence that people have in these notes, to a huge extent, will spell out whether or not this bonded instrument can survive beyond a month.However, judging by the reality surrounding bond notes so far, it can be justly said that, on its part, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has done little to inspire confidence in the people of Zimbabwe, if anything, they have stoked the fires of misapprehension.From the late-coming awareness campaigns to the unavailability of specimens, the central bank has fed the people s mistrust.The widely-held view that the surrogate currency will compound and encumber the economic paralysis is not far from reality.The ultimate blow was the one delivered by none other than Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, while addressing guests at a budget seminar in Bulawayo last week.Chinamasa delivered the sucker-punch when he highlighted that fake bond notes were already being circulated by criminal elements, at a time when even specimens of the bond notes have not been availed to the public.This is quite disturbing and honestly, to those who had warmed up to the idea of bond notes, it shakes their fragile confidence. What guarantee exists that even the bonded instruments will not fall victim to these unscrupulous people?True, even the United States dollar has counterfeit notes circulating, but probably very few people do not know the distinction between a counterfeit and an original when it comes to the American currency.Now, here we are talking of bond notes which, up to now, remain a mystery to the general public. Can the RBZ walk this tight rope?The natural question in light of Chinamasa s pronouncements is: How do you have counterfeit notes when the notes have not been released onto the market?What then is the RBZ doing in light of this confidence-sapping development, if it should be true?To add more to the disorientation, John Mangudya, the central bank chief, dismissed as untrue claims by Chinamasa that counterfeit bond notes were already being printed.What should be believed now? How much misunderstanding does this breed to a currency already suspected and resented by many?Again, Mangudya is on record saying there would be an independent board that would monitor the printing of bond notes. The board has not even been appointed.Surely, the RBZ has not and is not doing enough to build confidence in this currency ahead of its release.All that is happening bolsters the suspicion that the economy is retracing its footsteps to 2008.While the awareness campaigns are welcome, they are rather dim, not illuminating the exact information needed by the ordinary public.What people need are the specimens; the proposed denominations and, of course, the features then yes we have a serious central bank that is sure of its transactions. It is quite unfortunate and, by the look of things, one does not need to be an economist to see where the country may be heading.Zimbabweans have a profound fear of the bond notes, which smack of the Zimbabwean dollar retired last year.Zimbabweans are still traumatised by the hyperinflation period, which wiped away their savings and, hence, the misgivings around bond notes are not unfounded.Already, we can apparently see what low confidence people have in the coming currency through cash queues and people sleeping at banks.Banks have actually further reduced withdrawal limits because balances of the American dollar are dwindling.The low confidence has resulted in depositors withdrawing US dollar balances, a trend which is likely to march on in the coming weeks.Everyone wants to get the little of their US dollar out of the bank as soon as possible.The people s fear would be a major contributory factor towards the success or fall of these bond notes.But given the mistrust, the strong US currency will, expectedly, find its way to the black market.It is actually these bond notes that will reactivate the black market.Once a parallel market has been created, the US dollar will richly be exchanged for bond notes at a very high exchange rate to the benefit of a few unscrupulous people.The rationing of foreign currency, namely the US dollar, is set to worsen ahead of the bond notes and this is one telltale sign.The sceptics could be right. The bond notes will most likely become the only currency in circulation by default while the US dollar and the South African rand become endangered species only found in the parallel market.All said and done, we call upon the central bank to be transparent about this bonded currency as to inspire confidence in people who are the ultimate users of the money.
