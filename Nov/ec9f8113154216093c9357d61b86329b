There is a Shona folklore about a baboon who did not know what pfumvu (danger or trouble) meant. He duly inquired for a definition from his friend, the wise hare. By Justice Takesure,Our ReaderAs good actors they two were, a plan was hatched to plaster the two in lion clothing .The costumes made in the cool of the morning were held together by tar. And off they set to a lion s den to kill, as hinted mischievously, two birds with one stone: the first was to get close to King Lion and see what makes him tick; the second to discover the meaning of danger.The conversation was most pleasant as was the food. Baboon felt like a king.As the sun and temperatures rose, the tar melted and bits of costume from the baboon fell off revealing potential food to the lions.By this time the hare had disappeared on some pretext. To cut a long story short, the baboon narrowly escaped with his life when his disguise melted away.In the process, he was also schooled on the definition of danger.For a long time, Zanu PF has been told of the need for good governance, but gave no ear to it.They did not know, or pretended not to know, what good governance was. The current squabbles in the party, and between it and war veterans, are the result of poor governance.Now, hopefully, the party leadership is in the picture as danger overtakes it.The teflon coating that used to make the leadership and party literally get away with murder has melted, thanks to poor governance.Sometimes nature corrects itself.Instead of just pleading for dialogue among war veterans, as NewsDay reported yesterday, Defence minister Sydney Sekeremayi must summon the courage to table good governance on the politburo and Cabinet s agenda. Poor governance is probably the greatest national security threat.
