A major earthquake hit northeastern Japan early on Tuesday, causing authorities to issue a tsunami warning and thousands of residents to be evacuated from their homes. The 7.4&nbsp;magnitude quake struck off the coast of Fukushima, home to a nuclear power plant that suffered a dangerous meltdown after a massive offshore tremor caused a tsunami in 2011.The earthquake was also felt in Tokyo, some 285 kilometers (177 miles) away.&nbsp;Japan s Meteorological Agency warned coastal residents that the waves could be 3 meters (10 feet) high and urged them to flee to higher ground. Once the waves reached shore, however, they appeared to be about 1.40 meters tall.Evacuees gather at a school in Iwaki, Fukushima PrefectureTsunami warnings were also issued for the prefectures of Miyagi, Ibaraki, Aomori, and Chiba.
