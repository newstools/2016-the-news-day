ANXIETY STRICKEN CAPS United fans will have to wait a little bit longer to discover whether their team can claim the 2016 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League championship following the shelving of domestic action to pave way for the Warriors international friendly match against Tanzania at the weekend. BY HENRY MHARAIn a statement yesterday, the PSL announced that the league programme would resume next week with the last set of matches pencilled for the weekend of November 26-27. The Green Machine, who are gunning for their fifth top-flight league championship, enjoy a two-point advantage over nearest rivals, FC Platinum, with only two rounds of matches to play.With FC Platinum taking on third-placed Highlanders in their next match, Caps United can wrap up the title if the platinum miners fail to beat Highlanders with the Green Machine taking all three points against Ngezi Platinum Stars. Last week, the PSL deferred league matches to give way to the Chibuku Super Cup final.Lloyd Chitembwe and his team could avoid the final fixture anxieties in a match against Chapungu at Ascot Stadium with a win against a tricky Ngezi side riding high on the crest of a wave after winning the Chibuku Cup.It could also mean that the success-starved Green Machine supporters would celebrate the title with their team in their own backyard.But everything could go up in smoke if they fail to win, while FC Platinum defeat Bosso.FC Platinum have the best chance to wrestle it from Caps United, but a two-point gap between them means the platinum miners cannot afford anything less than six points in the last two matches.Mapeza takes his team to Bulawayo for a date against relegation-threatened Tsholotsho on the last day.Two weeks ago, Highlanders looked the likelier team to pip Caps United to the title, but lost ground when they fell to Tsholotsho a fortnight ago.Bosso, who are on 53 points, now rest their hopes on Caps United and FC Platinum both losing their final two matches.Top three s remaining fixturesCaps United v Ngezi Platinum (Home), Chapungu (Away) FC Platinum v Highlanders (H), Tsholotsho (A) Highlanders v FC Platinum (A), Hwange (H)
