He warned that&nbsp;if government forces were successful in taking one further district, the rebel-held&nbsp;part of eastern Aleppo would be split into two.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gathers information from multiple sources on the ground, said government forces held physical&nbsp;possession of 80 percent of Hanano, but that they had the full area in their line of fire."They are just hundreds of meters&nbsp;away from isolating the northern districts of east Aleppo from the southern ones," he said. Some 250,000 civilians have been trapped under a government siege in the rebel-held east, which&nbsp;has lasted months. The capture of Hanano is part of a government offensive to capture the city that is now in its 12th day.Since November 15, the Observatory has said, the&nbsp;bombardment of eastern Aleppo by the regime has killed 212 civilians, including 27 children.rc/cmk (AFP, dpa)
