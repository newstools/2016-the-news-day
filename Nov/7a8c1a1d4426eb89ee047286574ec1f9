Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa has announced hundreds more flight cancellations fpr Friday and Saturday.The strike affects flights departing from German airports, including long-haul flights. The industrial action is expected to greatly disrupt services in the big Lufthansa hubs Frankfurt and Munich. Lufthansa announced on Thursday it would cancel a further 830 short-and medium-haul flights on Friday.This means that just over a quarter of the airline's schedule will be affected Friday, hitting more than 100,000 travelers. Late Thursday the Cockpit union announced that the strike would continue for a fourth day on Saturday and affect all the long-haul flights from Germany scheduled for that day.&nbsp;Information numbersFor passengers wanting to know if their flights are affected, Lufthansa has installed a free service number 0800-8506070 and details are also available on&nbsp;their website.&nbsp;Within Germany, passengers can convert their flight ticket into a rail ticket with Deutsche Bahn.Other Lufthansa group airlines such as Eurowings, Swiss and Austrian Airlines aren't affected by the strike. &nbsp;The latest strike is the 14th since April 2014 in the long-running dispute. It comes as Lufthansa restructures to meet increasing competition from Gulf airlines and European budget carriers.&nbsp;The Lufthansa pilots on strike are demanding a pay rise of an average of 3.66 percent per year, retroactive for the past five years. The union says pilots have endured a wage freeze over that time and suffered a "significant loss of purchasing power" due to inflation, while Lufthansa has made billions in profits. It had offered a 2.5 percent wage hike.Lufthansa expects the strike to cost between seven&nbsp;and nine&nbsp;million euros ($7.4 to $9.6 million) a day.at/cho (rtr, dpa)
