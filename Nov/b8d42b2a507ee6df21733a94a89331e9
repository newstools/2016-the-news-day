UPCOMING gospel artiste, Rumbidzai Mabvuu has said people who pirate music lack respect for others hard work. BY LORRAINE MUROMOMabvuu who recently released his debut album, My Testimony in the University of God said musicians were pouring in a lot of money into production, only to benefit people stealing their work and called on the government to clamp down on the vice. There is need for a legislative Bill to deal with piracy once and for all because piracy on its own is lack of respect towards other people, he said.Mabvuu also appealed to established musicians to support upcoming artistes in the industry. I think well-established musicians must play a major role by engaging upcoming artistes as curtain raisers at their shows, he said.Mabvuu said his passion for music started in childhood, when he used to sing in church. In all my songs, I touch on aspects both spiritual and social, so that the word of God goes to its rightful owners and people are comforted on their day to day expedition on this troubled earth, he said
