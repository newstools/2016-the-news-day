A Russian helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the Syrian city of Palmyra on Thursday, but the opposing sides are offering conflicting explanations of&nbsp;what happened.The Russian military said that the helicopter was delivering humanitarian aid and&nbsp;came under fire as it was landing in the village of Huwaysis, more than 120 miles from its home base on Syria's northeast coast.But a news agency affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) claimed a Russian helicopter in Huwaysis had been destroyed by rocket fire.&nbsp;The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a non-governmental group that has been monitoring Syria's five-year-old civil war, appeared to corroborate the Russian view of the incident.&nbsp;Still,&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;did not make clear just what had happened, though it acknowledged the downed helicopter had to be abandoned.The Interfax news agency quoted a Russian defense ministry official in Syria as saying: "The helicopter sustained damage which prevented it from returning to the home air base. The crew was not hurt and was swiftly returned to Hmeimin air base by a search-and-rescue helicopter."Russia has lost four helicopters in Syria, where it is aiding the government of Bashar al-Assad.Russia to hold fireSeparately, Russia has also announced that Syrian forces will pull back to allow rebels to leave Aleppo during Moscow's brief unilateral ceasefire.Lt.
