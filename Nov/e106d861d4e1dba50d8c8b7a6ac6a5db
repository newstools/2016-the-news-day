NGEZI Platinum Stars goalkeeper Nelson Chadya is set to be named in the Zimbabwe national senior men s football squad to prepare for Sunday s international friendly match against Tanzania. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAWarriors coach Kalisto Pasuwa (pictured) is due to announce the squad today with Chadya among the local-based players set to feature.Chadya has previously been called up for the less glamorous Cosafa tournament but after a good season which saw him help Ngezi Platinum to Chibuku Super Cup success on Saturday after beating FC Platinum 3-1 in the final as well as guiding the team to a decent position on the league table, his efforts have been recognised with a call-up to the squad that kickstarts preparations for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations tournament with a warm-up game against the Taifa Stars.England-based Tendayi Darikwa and McCauley Bonne are some of the players that have been called up to the senior team so has Sweden-based Tino Kadewere.Bonne, who plays for Colchester United, made his debut for Zimbabwe in an international friendly against Morocco, while Darikwa, who turns out for English Premier League side Burnley, is expected to make his debut for the Warriors on Sunday if he avails himself.The Burnley defender, who has previously turned down invitations to play for the Warriors, has reportedly told the technical team management he was ready to come and play for Zimbabwe ahead of the Gabon tournament to be held in January.Poland-based midfielder Andre Gwaze, who played in a friendly against Uganda in June, has been overlooked amid reports that the technical team discovered he has been inactive..Gwaze, who used to play for top-flight side Gornik Zabrze, has been relegated to the third-tier division where he is on the books of LZS Piotrowka, who are also home to former Dynamos striker Takesure Chinyama.Last week, Pasuwa named a squad of only home-based players for the friendly against neighbours Zambia as the match fell outside the Fifa calendar for international games.The home-based Warriors went on to edge Zambia 1-0 courtesy of a headed goal by centre-back Teenage Hadebe. But with the Sunday match on the Fifa calendar for international matches, Pasuwa has called up foreign-based stars.
