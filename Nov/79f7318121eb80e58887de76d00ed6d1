ANDREW Nkiwane is among hundreds of villagers and farm workers in Bindura, who recently attended a local event aimed at concientising communities about the impacts of early child marriages. BY TONDERAYI MATONHO The recent ban of the negative practice by the Constitutional Court (ConCourt) in January this year, is not yet known by many of these villagers and farm workers and according to them, this meeting is just one of those gatherings organised by government and non-governmental organisations, Nkiwane, a school teacher in Shamva, said.He queried whether there was adequate national expertise on child rights, working in public policy analysis and advocacy with the government and development partners to build support and political capital in favour of effective policies, laws and budgets that promote the rights and well-being of children.According to experts, the ConCourt ruling of January 2016 has been an impetus to move the agenda forward, which is part of the global campaign to end child marriages.In its ruling, the ConCourt declared that section 78 of the Constitution sets 18 years as the minimum age of marriage and that any law to the contrary was unconstitutional.This, therefore, means the ConCourt ruling also declared as unconstitutional section 22 (1) of the Marriage Act, as well as any custom, which had promoted marriages involving minors. The Women s Affairs, Gender and Community Development ministry, with support from the United Nations Children s Fund, United Nations Women, United Nations Population Fund and Child Rights and Women s Rights Coalition, have been working on a national action plan to end child marriages and its related communication for development activities. We are pushing for the alignment of current legislation with provisions of the Constitution, which bar child marriages, the ministry s representative, Stephen Nyaruwata, said at the World Population Day commemorations in Harare recently.According to UNFPA, to empower adolescents means giving them the tools to become more influential within productive sectors in their societies. In order to achieve this, countries need to end all forms of discrimination faced by young people, particularly adolescent girls, such as forced and child marriages as well as sexual violence, which can result in unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and HIV infections.World Vision has also urged the legislature and executive to expedite alignment of laws and put in place policies to operationalise the law.Once the marriage laws are harmonised, it will be incumbent upon the government, media, civil society organisations, traditional leaders, as well as religious organisations to collectively work together in raising awareness on the new laws abolishing child marriages, World Vision noted.Renowned women s rights activist and legislator, Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga (pictured), said the country s flawed legal framework was contributing to the fuelling of child marriages. It seems we clearly value animals more than our children, because if you steal a beast, the minimum mandatory jail sentence is 10 years, she lamented. What is more important, an animal or a human being? Perpetrators of child marriages should be arrested and rot in jail because they have no place in this modern world. We need a minimum sentence, as well as for those who force young girls into marriage. In a report on the high prevalence of child marriages in Mashonaland Central province presented in Parliament by the Portfolio Committee on Women s Affairs in August 2016, it cited public officials, including legislators, police officers, teachers and traditional leaders as the main culprits in the sexual exploitation of minors. The Zimbabwe Republic Police must, with immediate effect, enhance patrols in villages and engage the broader community leadership and school children on laws against child abuse, domestic and gender-based violence and child marriages, the chairperson of the committee, Biata Nyamupinga, said.She said Zimbabwe was among countries with high prevalence of child marriages, where 5% of women and 0,3% of men aged between 15 and 49 years were married at 15 years. The country has a 31% prevalence rate of child marriages, with nearly one in 10 teenage girls giving birth every year.The Institute for Young Women Development has also called upon Zimbabweans to desist from socialisation and other practices that perpetuate child marriages, and instead, embrace rights-oriented and positive socialisation of girls and boys. A social worker, Johanne Mhlanga, says: Authorities should have deliberate policies that deploy NGOs to the most needy and remote areas, rather than having them concentrated in Harare, Mutare, and other easy-to-reach areas.There is need for deliberate policy to deploy NGOs in those areas to fight the sexual abuse scourge. The ConCourt judgment, however, does not make marrying a child a criminal offence. This has to be codified with significant punishment as a matter of urgency, according to observers. The government is implored to speed up harmonisation of the country s marriage laws so that they criminalise perpetrators of child marriages, a statement from World Vision Zimbabwe said. Access to education still remains a pipe dream for children from underprivileged communities, particularly in rural areas, says a Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (Zimvac) 2016 Rural Livelihoods Assessment.The survey indicates that about 32% of children in the country s rural areas were not going to school due to financial constraints, followed by 24%, who were considered to be too young.Other reasons given for not attending school included being not interested in school (3%) and pregnancy through child marriage (2%), among others.United Nations Population Fund regional adviser, Federico Tobar has said: In addition to strengthening health, education and social services, there must be investment to promote demand, with interventions to motivate young people to build a sustained life project. According to Nkiwane, ending child marriages will become a reality if only policies and laws were re-aligned with the Constitution.
