Dialogue however requires the two sides to be willing to talk to each other," Schulz said. "I continue to hope that the European Parliament will be able to visit Turkey soon."Meanwhile German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier wrapped up a tense visit to Ankara on Tuesday.The EU has long been critical of Turkey's human rights record. The coup purge, with tens of thousands of people being detained, has strained relations to breaking point. Many MEPs support breaking off already difficult membership talks with Ankara.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly rejected EU criticism of the post-coup crackdown, and on Monday he warned the bloc it should decide by the end of the year whether the membership talks should continue.Formal talks began in 2005 but there has been painfully little progress despite the two sides agreeing to speed up the process in March as part of an accord aimed at curbing migrant flows into Greece.bik/bw&nbsp;(AFP, EUP)&nbsp;
