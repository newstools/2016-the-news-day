Hamburg 2-5 Borussia Dortmund&nbsp; (Aubameyang 4', 23', 27', 48', Dembele 76'&nbsp;- M ller 55', 81')Aubameyang came back&nbsp;from an internal suspension to spectacular effect with four goals as rock bottom side Hamburg completely fell apart at home.Hamburg hero Uwe Seeler was celebrating his 80th birthday but Dortmund received an early present of their own with dreadful goalkeeping from Rene Adler allowing Aubameyang to tap in. Adler made a complete hash of saving Eme Mor s scuffed effort, pushing the ball right into the Gabon striker s path.It was a microcosm of Hamburg s sorry&nbsp;season and was a quick response for Aubameyang after he was dropped for the Champions League win over Sporting in midweek, reportedly for flying to a party in Milan without permission.He was partying for the right reasons midway through the first half after more kamikaze Hamburg defending. Usual suspect Johan Djourou lost the ball to Mor as the last man and the Turkey winger ran in before squaring for arguably Aubameyang s easiest ever goal.The striker then proved any rumored rift with&nbsp;Thomas Tuchel was over by running to embrace the coach on the sideline. Aubameyang's&nbsp;third before halftime was also simple.&nbsp;A&nbsp;kick up field was flicked on without any Hamburg pressure and Aubameyang did the rest, with Adler possibly at fault again.In contrast, the&nbsp;forward s fourth was a special effort from the edge of the box as he rocketed to joint-top of the scoring chart with 11 goals alongside Cologne s Anthony Modeste.Hamburg, who have only two points from 10 games, pulled one back through Nicolai M ller before Ousmane Dembele made it 5-1 and M ller scored&nbsp;only Hamburg's fourth goal this term.Dortmund are up to fifth while it was another terrible display from Markus Gisdol s side with his appointment in September already coming under increasing scrutiny.Bayern Munich 1-1 Hoffenheim (Zuber o.g. 34'&nbsp;- Demirbay 16')Bayern s patchy season&nbsp;continued with the league leaders third draw of the campaign against&nbsp;high-flying Hoffenheim, who&nbsp;remain&nbsp;unbeaten.&nbsp;The hosts were wearing one-off kits made out of waste plastic for the ocean and their early first-half play was also rubbish with Hoffenheim taking the lead through Kerem Demirbay s thunderous effort right into the top corner.Steven Zuber netted an unfortunate own goalThe champions only leveled thanks to Steven Zuber s own goal, when he slid in and deflected Douglas Costa s cross into the net.Mats Hummels hit the post and Thomas M ller missed a glorious chance for Bayern in stoppage time,&nbsp;but the away side had opportunities&nbsp;too.It was young Hoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann s first game against Bayern and he proved himself once more with his surprise packages staying in third spot.Frankfurt 1-0 Cologne (Gacinovic 5 )Cologne lost ground on the top teams for the second time in three weeks after Mijat Gacinovic headed in early. Timothy Chandler's cross was deflected and Serbian Gacinovic nodded home before Timo Horn could get there.Cologne&nbsp;had half a shout for a penalty and top scorer Modeste headed wide before Yuya Osako&nbsp;failed to connect properly with a header when well positioned. The visitors pushed extremely hard in the second half but to no avail.Nico Kovac seems to have transformed Frankfurt into a hard-to-beat outfit and they remain seventh, now level on points with the sixth-placed Billy Goats.Freiburg 0-3 Wolfsburg (Gomez 41', 53', Rodriguez 86' pen.)Wolfsburg put their recent woes behind them and boosted interim coach Valerien Ismael with a comprehensive win in&nbsp;Freiburg.Freiburg goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow made a big save to deny Mario Gomez after 30 minutes, but the Germany striker eventually got on the scoresheet with a powerful header in the Freiburg rain. Maximilian Arnold almost made it 2-0 soon after but he blasted over.Gomez put his early season scoring problems behind him with a second following a very quick break after the ball got stuck on the wet pitch during a Freiburg attack.&nbsp;The home side s Christian G nter then saw red for bringing down Daniel Didavi in the box and Ricardo Rodriguez converted the penalty.&nbsp;It was Freiburg s first home defeat of the season.Leverkusen 3-2&nbsp;Darmstadt (Calhanoglu 32', Brandt 56', Aranguiz 69'&nbsp; Colak 47', Vrancic 85')Following&nbsp;the midweek Champions League win at Tottenham Hotspur,&nbsp;Leverkusen ended&nbsp;a good week on a high.Hakan Calhanoglu rifled in beautifully&nbsp;after a well-worked move, but the visitors came out undeterred in the second half and a delightful cross from Marcel Heller was turned in at the far post by Antonio-Mirko Colak.A superb header from Julian Brandt following a pinpoint ball from Julian Baumgartlinger gave&nbsp;the hosts the lead again, with Charles Aranguiz adding a third.&nbsp;Mario Vrancic scored late on for dogged Darmstadt but Leverkusen clung on to move up to seventh.Ingolstadt 0 -2 Augsburg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Bobadilla 85', Altintop 90')A dour encounter between two struggling sides was settled late on when the visitors burst into life. Raul Bobadilla scored&nbsp;a brilliant free kick&nbsp;and Halil Altintop added a second&nbsp;either&nbsp;side of Tobias Levels red card for second bottom Ingolstadt.
