Jens Todt, who is currently the sporting director at second-division club Karlsruhe, told the DPA news agency on Monday that he had not spoken to the Bundesliga side about the vacancy."The situation is the same as it was last week. There are no contract talks with Hamburg and there has been no contact with me," said Todt, who has long been regarded as a candidate to replace Peter Kn bel, who was sacked at the end of last season. Todt is thought to be close to the Hamburg chairman, Dietmar Beiersdorfer.
