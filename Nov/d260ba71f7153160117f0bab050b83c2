FORMER Major Playerz band member, Benson Chihava, popularly known as Chyllur in hip-hop circles, says he would not deterred by the split of the group, but will soldier on with his career, although he cherishes support from his former band mates. BY LORRAINE MUROMOChihava told NewsDay in an interview that he was determined to make his solo music career work. The split has had a temporary setback on my career because, with their backing, I would have done much more in improving my solo career in terms of creativity and push, he said. I have had to start afresh as a solo artiste, but on the other hand, I think I have been doing incredibly well in terms of artistry than what I was doing when I was still in the group. Chihava said he was currently working on an album and a mix tape titled The Reconstruction of Chyllur and was both excited and optimistic it would do well. I am more than excited, especially because people thought our music was dead, but I am bringing it back, he said. I have worked very hard over the years, defining my sound and sleepless nights working in the studio are about to pay off. I am currently working on an album and mix tape and my fans can expect a well done album in December. They should also look out for my collaboration next year, where I am aiming to work with Cassper Nyovest. Chihava, together with brothers, Thomas and Richard Marufu, constituted Major Playerz and the group collapsed when the siblings left for Australia and Chyllur was left behind to pursue a solo career.The group produced two albums titled The Construction in 2003 and Raising The Bar in 2007.
