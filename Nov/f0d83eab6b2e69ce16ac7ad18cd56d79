German national team coach Joachim L w said&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;that Benedikt H wedes (pictured above)&nbsp;will start alongside Mats Hummels in the heart of Germany's defense in their friendly&nbsp;against Italy&nbsp;in Milan&nbsp;Tuesday night.The Schalke central defender has been&nbsp;no stranger to L w's teams over the years and comes into the starting 11 to replace the injured Bayern Munich defender, Jerome Boateng. This will be the 28-year-old's first start for the national team since Germany's 2-0 defeat to France in the semifinals of Euro 2016.Aside from the two central defenders, L w also confirmed that Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno will start in goal&nbsp;after&nbsp;Barcelona shot-stopper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen&nbsp;played in the 8-0 win over San Marino. First-choice keeper Manuel Neuer pulled out of the squad for this international break due to illness.&nbsp;This will be Leno's&nbsp;first start for Germany since their friendly against Slovakia in&nbsp;May of this year. "I've thought a lot about the players' workload. None of them will return to their clubs overstrained,"&nbsp;L w told reporters at the prematch press conference in Milan. "Every player is ready to play; Bernd Leno will start in goal; Benedikt H wedes will be alongside Mats Hummels."H wedes takes the place of young midfielder-turned-defender Joshua Kimmich, who'll likely not be the only member of the&nbsp;youthful side that played against San Marino to find himself on the bench on Tuesday, as&nbsp;L w looks&nbsp;to his more experienced players against Italy.&nbsp;One senior player who may miss the game is Wolfsburg striker Mario Gomez, who suffered a bruised thigh in Friday's match.&nbsp;"Should Mario Gomez have any problems we won't take a risk," said L w. Meanwhile fellow Wolves teammate Yannick Gerhardt is set to make his debut at left-back.&nbsp;Although Germany have beaten the Azzurri both&nbsp;of their last two&nbsp;encounters, including a 6-5 win on penalties in the quarterfinals of Euro 2016, L w expects to face a typically well-organized&nbsp;Italian team.&nbsp;"We are expecting a very well tactically set-up Italy side tomorrow,"&nbsp;L w said&nbsp;ahead of what surely be a hugely competitive clash, despite being a friendly, as well as Germany's final game of 2016.
