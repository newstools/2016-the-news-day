Gweru City Council has set $2 as a registration fee for urban farmers, failure of which their crops would be slashed, Southern Eye has established. BY Stephen ChadengaActing town clerk, Edgar Mwedzi said urban cultivation would only be allowed to plot holders, who register for the 2016/17 agricultural season and failing to comply with city by-laws would result in crops being destroyed. We are informing all urban agriculture small plot holders in low and high-density areas that they are required to register their plots at nearest council offices, he said in a notice. They will do that through paying a non-refundable fee of $2. Please note that agricultural activities will only be permitted on small plots, which have already been approved by council, so for those small plot holders, who fail to register their fields by December 31, 2016 council will be left with no option except to slash the crops. Over the years, as the economic situation continues to worsen, a majority of urban dwellers have resorted to urban farming as part of measures to supplement their food.City councillors have, however, raised concern that residents till on pieces of land set aside for urban expansion flouting council by-laws in the process.A few years ago, residents in Makokoba suburb in Bulawayo clashed with council authorities after municipal workers slashed the maize crop, which was at tasselling stage.
