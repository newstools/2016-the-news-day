The team did not stay longer than a season in the league on both occasions.They finally found a way at the weekend, thanks to former Highlanders and Warriors midfielder, Ngodzo. We are very proud of our head coach (Ngodzo). It s a great achievement for him to win the championship in his first year as head coach. It was a well-deserved promotion. We will sit as club management and map the way forward, Sibanda said.With promotion and relegation in the top flight still mired in controversy, Sibanda could not be drawn to comment on the club s future save to say they will plan for whatever will be decided. It s too early to comment on anything for now. We will just concentrate on celebrating the feat of winning the championship. It s our first time to win it, he said.Sibanda said they are also proud of their largely youthful side, which clinched the title with 64 points, just ahead of Bulawayo Chiefs, who had the same number of points but an inferior goal difference.
