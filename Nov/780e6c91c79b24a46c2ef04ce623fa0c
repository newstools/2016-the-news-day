The US national was evacuated on board an Omani military jet bound for Muscat on Sunday along with Yemenis wounded in the country's conflict, Oman's foreign ministry said in a statement.It added that the man, identified by US authorities as&nbsp;Wallead Yusuf Pitts Luqman, was released&nbsp;after&nbsp;"a request by the US government (to Oman) to continue helping in (releasing) its citizens held in Yemen."Oman - a member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - has sought to remain neutral during&nbsp;Yemen's 19-month conflict. The sultanate also enjoys good ties with the Shiite Houthi rebels, which are backed by Iran and control the Yemeni&nbsp;capital and much of the country's&nbsp;north.In an apparent reference to the Houthis, the ministry said Luqman&nbsp;was freed after "coordination with concerned parties in Sanaa."US Secretary of State John Kerry&nbsp;expressed his "deepest gratitude and appreciation" to the government of Oman "for their leadership and assistance in securing Mr Luqman's safe return.""We also recognize this positive gesture by the Houthis," Kerry added. "We will be relentless in our efforts to secure the release of Americans unjustly detained overseas."
