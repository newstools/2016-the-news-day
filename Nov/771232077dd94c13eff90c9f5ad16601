SENEGALESE professor, Abdoulaye Bathily has approached Zimbabwe for support for his candidature for the African Union chairmanship elections to be held next January, but the Southern African country has thrown its weight behind Botswana candidate, Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi. BY VENERANDA LANGASecretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Joey Bimha last Friday confirmed that Bathily had approached Zimbabwe seeking support to clinch the top AU post to succeed South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.Bathily formally launched his campaign for the AU presidency last week in Dakar Senegal. I confirm that the Senegalese (Bathily) has approached Zimbabwe, lobbying for our support for his candidature to the AU chairmanship, Bimha said. However, each region in Africa is currently lobbying for their candidate and so anyone is free to come and campaign, he said.Bimha said, at the moment, Zimbabwe&#8217;s decision is to vote for the candidate from Botswana, who is being backed by the Southern African region. All we can promise at the moment is that if our candidate falls by the wayside earlier in the preliminary elections, then we can consider backing the Senegalese candidate. As Zimbabwe, we are currently backing the Southern African candidate from Botswana. During the launch of his campaign in Dakar, Bathily garnered support from high level political figures, academics and civic society members from Africa.Among his backers was Zimbabwean pan-African activist, Hesphina Rukato, the executive director of African Development Solutions.As part of the key messages during Bathily s campaign launch, Rukato said: We need an Africanist such as Bathily to lead the AU. Patricia McFadden from the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute also described Bathily as someone courageous and innovative, who can generate the shift Africa needs to move forward.Bathily is the Ecowas candidate for the AU chairmanship.
