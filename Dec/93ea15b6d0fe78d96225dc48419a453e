LEGENDARY musician Oliver Tuku Mtukudzi s shoe line, Hai-Kobo, in partnership with his brand Tuku Music recently unveiled a line of branded school footwear range at the inaugural auction held at Athienitis in Harare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOThe Hai-Kobo branded school shoes, which carry Tuku s trademark signature, are available at Athienitis Fife Avenue supermarket and selling between $15 and $20.Speaking to NewsDay on the sidelines of the auction, the shoe manufacturer s spokesperson, Ephraim Maisiri, said part of proceeds from the auction would be used in raising awareness of how disadvantaged pupils need support and to distribute Hai-Kobo school shoes to them.Maisiri said they were inviting corporates, non-governmental organisations and well-wishers who would like to partner Hai-Kobo and assist the disadvantaged pupils in different communities. The hardship of coming from a poor background, where one has to go to school barefooted, inspired the birth of this Tuku genuine leather premium footwear branded as Hai-Kobo, he said. To this end, we would like to partner with all Zimbabweans and the international community to play our part in helping less privileged children in our communities by raising awareness and the necessary resources to provide them with appropriate school shoes. Maisiri said Hai-Kobo was a dance meant to release distress emotions, which had been translated into the shoe brand. These shoes are designed for durability and value for cash. We believe if we all pull our resources together we can make a difference in the lives of our future leaders, said Maisiri, adding that while some Hai-Kobo shoes were already available on the market in Barbours Store in Harare and Attach in South Africa.He said the full range of the shoe brand would be launched in August next year.Maisiri said Hai-Kobo had come up with a series of exclusive genuine leather foot wear made from the world s best leather. These shoes are made from the softest and finest calf leather hides, full leather lining and genuine leather soles, he said.
