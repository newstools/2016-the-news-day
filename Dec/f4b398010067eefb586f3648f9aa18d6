THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has given its residents an early Christmas present after it reduced the weekly water-shedding schedule from 72 to 48 hours for the duration of the festive season. By KHANYILE MLOTSHWACouncil spokesperson Nesisa Mpofu in a statement, said: Shedding of water will be suspended during the holiday period from December 23, 2016 to January 2, 2017. The council will make a review of the shedding programme after the holidays dependent on the consumption patterns and the amount of inflows received into the city s supply dams. Mpofu urged residents to continue using water sparingly saying the city s supply dams were still critically low after receiving a cumulative 15 291 166 cubic meters in inflows since the beginning of the rain season.She said Insiza Mayfair Dam received 4 522 026 cubic metres, Inyankuni (1 7775 720), Lower Ncema (325 350), Umzingwane (6 186 200), Upper Ncema 2 319 660), and Mtshabezi (162 210).Mpofu said Umzingwane and Upper Ncema dams remained decommissioned as they have not received significant inflows.BCC imposed a 72-hour water shedding regime on its residents in early November as part of measures to preserve the fast dwindling water resources.
