The European Union is stepping up its criticism of the Polish government over its seeming lack of respect for the rule of law , and issued more recommendations for the government to fix its problems.EU Vice-President Frans Timmermans said Wednesday that the 28-nation bloc "will not drop this matter" until the governing Law and Justice Party (PiS) satisfies questions about the independence of its judiciary and other issues, which are widely perceived as backsliding on fundamental political rights.

Blocking, taking away freedom from citizens, not allowing normal movements are all criminal acts and these&nbsp;acts are accepted (by the opposition)," Kaczynski said."This is really a road to a great calamity."But it is Kaczynski and his PiS party that are pushing the country towards calamity, according to the leading opposition parties - Civic Platform and Modern. Both parties are, pro-European centrist parties who insist it is the government that is assaulting democracy.Large numbers of Polish citizens agree. Thousands have taken to the streets of Warsaw and other cities in recent weeks to protest the country's latest crisis"If PiS is not open to concessions ... then I do not see other options than to continue the protest until it is effective," Ryszard Petru, leader of the liberal Nowoczesna opposition party, told reporters said he's ready to carry on the protests over the coming weeks.bik/rc (AP, Reuters)&nbsp;
