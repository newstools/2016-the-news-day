The investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee announced on Thursday that it had banned former&nbsp;South Africa Football Association President Kirsten Nematandani&nbsp;from all soccer related activity for five years for having banned FIFA's rules on conduct, loyalty and duty of disclosure.It also said it had imposed lifelong bans on former Zimbabwe Football Association executive Jonathan Musavengana and the former coach of Togo, Bana Tchanile, breaching the FIFA Code of Ethics on bribery and corruption.The most prominent of the three, Nematandani, had been put on "special leave" in December 2012 following a FIFA report into match-fixing. However he was reinstated one month later without having been cleared of any wrongdoing. He later left the South African FA.Tchanile was already banned from football for three years by Togo's FA after he took a team masquerading as the country's national side to play a friendly with Bahrain in 2010.Musavengana was penalized by the Zimbabwean FA over alleged match-fixing in 2012.
