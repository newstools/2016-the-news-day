FIRST LADY Grace Mugabe s Manicaland ally, Letina Undenge s bid to contest the Chimanimani parliamentary seat on a Zanu PF ticket went up in smoke at the weekend when she was walloped by Nokuthula Matsikenyere who entered the party primary elections as an underdog. BY KENNETH NYANGANIMatsikenyere romped to victory after garnering 2 881 votes, while Undenge got 1 204 votes. Other parliamentary aspirants Taisen Dube and John Gwatidzo got 553 and 87 votes respectively.The seat fell vacant after ex-minister Munacho Mutezo was axed from Zanu PF and Parliament for reportedly supping with former Vice-President Joice Mujuru s opposition Zimbabwe People First.Although Manicaland provincial chairperson Samuel Undenge was not reachable for comment yesterday, sources said his wife Letina, who is Women s League secretary for administration, was planning to travel to Harare to challenge the results. Sources said Letina lost because of her dictatorial tendencies. Under normal circumstances she was supposed to win the election considering that her husband is the chairman of the province. People voted against her because, of late, she has personalised First Lady Grace Mugabe (G40) s Cashel Valley irrigation project, the source said. She was acting like party chairman of the province. She wants to run everything from main wing and most G40 supporters just decided to vote against her because almost three quarters of the provincial women s league are not happy with Letina s conduct.
