Nice price, rapid delivery, and decent quality are all important for most online purchasers. The opinions of previous customers can also play a role, however. Shops with four or five stars turn over around 30% more than those with poorer ratings. So companies such as Trusted Shops have turned the confidence factor into a business model. Staff use special software to check the authenticity of customer appraisals around 15,000 comments per day and then award a seal of quality for trustworthy online traders. Around 25,000 stores across the EU already bear the certificate.
