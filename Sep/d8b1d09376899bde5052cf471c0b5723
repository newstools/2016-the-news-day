"Victory!" tweeted French Environment Minister Segolene Royal following Friday's agreement. She later added that Europe had "seized the moment in response to climate urgency."Royal, who is also chair of the United Nations COP 21 climate talks, said the EU had lived up to its responsibilities and was making history by agreeing to ratify the deal.European Union President Donald Tusks praised the green light given by EU ministers, saying it meant that "what some believed impossible is now real."Other environment ministers said the joint deal was significant, given EU members' different energy requirements and concerns.&nbsp;The EU's 28 states are responsible for about 12 percent of global emissions.The fast-track decision came hours after a new&nbsp;report predicted that climate change would surpass dangerous levels despite the Paris agreement.The decision to accelerate ratification was made despite some national parliaments being slow to&nbsp;approve the deal.&nbsp;The EU-wide ratification is expected to take about a month to complete. The European Parliament is expected to approve it next week.Last December's landmark deal, which was signed by 170 world leaders, seeks to keep average temperature rises "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F) above preindustrial times to tackle climate change.By the end of the century, nations will be required to shift away&nbsp;from fossil fuels as part of efforts to limit extreme weather and rising sea levels. The Paris deal won't take effect until 55 countries - accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions - have ratified or accepted it through their domestic lawmaking processes.Sixty-one parties have already ratified it, but they only account for 48 percent of global emissions. The EU agreement will help the deal pass the 55 percent threshold.Brussels fast-tracked the deal due to the slow process of individual member states in ratifying the deal domestically, although seven EU countries including Germany and France have ratified the deal&nbsp;already.The&nbsp; US and China, who are jointly responsible for nearly 40 percent of global carbon emissions, also agreed to ratify the pact earlier this month. India is set to formally validate the deal on Sunday.mm/sms (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
