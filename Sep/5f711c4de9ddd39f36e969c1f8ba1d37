FORMER Warriors goalkeeper, Tapuwa Kapini says the Warriors looked shaky in their 2017 Caf Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Guinea on Sunday. OnlineThe Highlands Park keeper in the South African Premier Soccer League says Kalisto Pasuwa s men still have a lot of work to do.The former AmaZulu and Platinum Stars net-minder insists that his compatriots must rectify their shortcomings ahead of the continental tournament. I watched that match [against Guinea] and I think we lacked tactical awareness. I do not want to be too critical because I am also a player and I am aware of the challenges that are associated with playing away from home, Kapini told KickOff.com. Maybe, knowing that the team had already qualified was something at the back of the players minds throughout the match. Look, Zimbabwean football fans will always be demanding and are hard to please. Making the semi-finals of Afcon will be very hard, but this is football. The coach and players need to work very hard towards this objective. The former Highlanders keeper was part of the Warriors squad at Afcon in 2004 and 2006.Although they went to Guinea having already booked their spot in Gabon, the Warriors succumbed to a 1-0 loss in Conakry.
