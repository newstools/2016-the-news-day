ZIMBABWE International loose forward, Kingsley Lang, will lead local rugby giants Old Georgians RFC in their maiden campaign in the rebranded Gold Cup, South Africa s top competition for non-university rugby union clubs, which gets underway this weekend. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOOld Georgians, who are Zimbabwe s sole representatives, will be on the road in their opening fixture, as they kickstart their campaign with a tough away encounter against White River Rugby Club in Mpumalanga, South Africa, tomorrow.Lang, who missed the Sables Africa Cup campaign due to injury, is one of the most experienced players in the squad, which has a good balance of experienced and upcoming young players.The 30-year-old loose forward, who played for Jersey RFC in the English Championship before relocating back to Zimbabwe last year, is one of the several seasoned players in the side, which includes long-serving Zimbabwe rugby stalwart flank, Jacques Leitao, lock, Fortune Chipendo, scrumhalf, Graham Kulback and prop, Jakov Jakov.Old Georgians also look to have embraced youth ahead of the Gold Cup tournament, as their squad also features three former youth internationals wing, Tawanda Ngosi, centre, Shingi Katsvere and eighthman, Moses Gunda.The duo of Katsvere and Gunda were part of the Young Sables that finished second to Namibia in the Junior Africa Cup in Windhoek two weeks ago, while Ngosi was part of the Zimbabwe Under-20 side for the World Rugby Under-20 Trophy early this year.The well-balanced squad also features a number of Zimbabwe Sevens rugby stars in flyhalf Lenience Tambwera, centre, Boyd Rouse and wingers, Stephan Hunduza and Kuda Chiwanza.Old Georgians coach, Grant Mitchell said he was happy with how his team s preparations had gone and backed his charges to make the country proud. Everything has gone according to plan. We have prepared as best as we could do and we are not focusing much on the opposition. It s the strongest squad we ve got at available at the moment. We lost two of our front row players (Pieter Joubert and Farai Lioga) through injury, but we ve got one or two coming back from injury set-backs, he said. We have a number of experienced players in our squad, but we ve also injected some youth in Tawanda Ngosi, Moses Gunda and Shingi Katsvere. They are all very talented and have got lot of potential and like everyone they ve earned their place in the squad. Old Georgians earned the right to represent the country after dispatching Old Hararians 39-20 in the final of the local qualifying tournament held earlier this year.The Groombridge-based side will join 19 other teams in a competition that will be played in a Rugby World Cup-style format consisting of eight pool matches per week for five weeks up until October 8.The top two from each group will progress to the quarter-finals a week later.
