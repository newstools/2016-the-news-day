BULAWAYO-based top model, Tracey-Anne Buckley Aggett, clinched the the first princess crown at the glamorous Mrs Universe 2016 beauty pageant held in Guangzhou, China, last Saturday. BY ARTS REPORTERMrs Universe country director for Zimbabwe, Patience Lusengo, saluted Agget for her beauty and skill that saw her clinch second position. Tracey-Anne is a creative visionary, ambitious entrepreneur, motivational speaker and gentle soul. Few of these come with the glitz and glam of centre stage. Instead, they tell the story of a woman, who pursues purpose. A woman, who is down-to-earth, a loyal friend with a generous spirit, someone with a heart for the downtrodden and who just happens to be strikingly beautiful, Lusengo said in a statement. It is not about the crown. This beauty queen has her priorities straight and is determined to beat the clich by truly demonstrating what it means to turn a crown into a platform . Her sincere desire is to be a voice for those who are unable to plead their plight in particular, women who are victims of domestic abuse and children in need. Tracey s personal battle to fall pregnant and the loss of two children before carrying to full term has also opened her heart to women struggling with similar problems. Apart from her schedule as a top model, Agett is a gifted fashion styling and image consultant, make-up artiste, fashion merchandiser and is into retail management. Mrs Universe is an international pageant that opens many doors worldwide, such as networking opportunities with companies and individuals. The top five winners were crowned on Monday evening.
