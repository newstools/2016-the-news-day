OPPOSITION Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru (pictured), has taken her charm offensive to Matabeleland South province, where she is seeking to connect with families of Gukurahundi victims by visiting mass graves such as Bhalagwe in Kezi district. BY SILAS NKALA Mujuru announced her planned tour of the Gukurahundi mass graves during a ZimPF campaign rally at Pelandaba Stadium in Gwanda on Saturday.She said ZimPF was a people-centred party , hence, her decision to visit the people, hear and have a feel of how they survive so as to make people-oriented policies. I am here today and I cannot say I have met all the people of Matabeleland South. I will visit Beitbridge, Plumtree (and) Insiza. I will visit Bhalagwe in Kezi. That is where I came from and that is where we can be told that we are lost or not, Mujuru said. I want to hear and see how my people live. I do not want to expect these people to vote for me when they have never seen me in their area. Visiting the people is what can make one know what they want. The government-sponsored genocide, which saw over 20 000 people in Matabeleland and Midlands being killed by the North Korea trained Fifth Brigade, occurred in the early 1980s when Mujuru was a Cabinet minister in President Robert Mugabe s administration.
