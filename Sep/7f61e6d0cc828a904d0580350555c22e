THE highly-anticipated Splash Paints comedy night headlined by Pakistani comedian, Mr Pak Bean, (real name Asif Muhammad), on Saturday at Harare International Conference Centre turned out to be a colossal disappointment after it failed to live up to its billing. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOThere was little laughter at the show, as the audience failed to connect to the visitng comedian s humour.The sensational look-alike of British comedian Rowan Atkinson, popularly known as Mr Bean, failed to impress at his maiden performance, leaving those he shared the stage with to steal the limelight.Mr Pak Bean, who was in the country courtesy of Zimbabwe s Splash Paints and Plastic Manufacturers, shared the stage with local comedians Simba The Comic King, who was the host and Long John, who also disappointed.Clive Chigubhu was the star of the night with an impressive act.For the better part of the concert, the voices of a few children, who attended the show, could be heard in the almost empty auditorium whenever, Mr Pak Bean took to the stage during other comedian s sets, as he had no stand-alone act.While local comedians tried their best to make the audience laugh, their sets were greatly laden with dry jokes that saw some of the audience walking out, with some resorting to personal conversations instead of watching the acts.The only notable and hilarious jokes for the night came from Bulawayo-based, Chigubhu, who made the audience laugh, particularly with his joke on Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko s long hotel stay.
