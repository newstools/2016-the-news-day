Bangajena also draws on her extensive background in wheelchair marathon.Takudzwa Gwariro (3 seat) and Chipo Zento (spare) began in March 2016 and were part of the crew for their first race in Gavirate, Italy.A long time rugby player, Gwariro sustained an injury in his final year of high school, making him classifiable as a para-rower.He is a 20-year-old junior teacher with a dream to study law and go to university outside of Africa. Chipo Zento was essential to the crew s first race in Gavirate and will be the spare for the team in Rio. Michelle Garnett (2 seat) is the newest rower of the group, joining the team in May 2016.Rowing at the Paralympic Games goes from 9-11 September 2016 at Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Rio, Brazil.
