After their Javier Hernandez-inspired comeback against Mainz on Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen will be looking to get their first win in this season's Champions League when they travel to face 2004 runners up Monaco on Tuesday. And with the lethal Mexican back in form, confidence is high in the Leverkusen camp.After Hernandez' treble secured a 3-2 win on Saturday, Schmidt declared that his star man was back to his best. The poacher, nicknamed Chicharito, is sure to be vital to his side's chances both domestically and in Europe."He wasn't fully fit, but now he's back on top form," Schmidt said. "It also helped him that he had a strike partner in the closing stages when Stefan Kiessling came on as that gave him more room to operate. He doesn't hesitate when he gets a chance."The German side started their Champions League matchday 1 fixture in explosive fashion,&nbsp;taking a two goal lead in the opening 15 minutes before crumbling and conceding twice in two first half minutes to allow CSKA Moscow to leave the BayArena with a point.Fourth seeds Monaco got off to a much better start with a surprise win over English side Tottenham Hotspur and the principality club have both history and form on their side in this fixture. Monaco have not lost in their four previous meetings with Leverkusen, beating them home and away in the group stages two seasons ago.Saturday's win was only Leverkusen's second Bundesliga victory this term and they currently sit in mid-table. Monaco have enjoyed a much stronger start and currently occupy second spot in Ligue 1, just a point off leaders OGC Nice.Roger Schmidt thinks Monaco have improved since they last met Leverkusen Despite the omens, Leverkusen head coach Schmidt is confident, if a little wary:"Monaco perhaps have an even stronger side than they did two years ago," he said on Monday. "But if we play like we did in the second half against Mainz then we can take away (the points)."Leverkusen, who have yet to progress further than the last 16 of the Champions League since losing the 2002 final to Real Madrid, will be without Karim Bellarabi, who will be out until the end of 2016 with a groin problem. Monaco striker Radamel Falcao is a doubt for the hosts. The Colombian is recovering from a concussion sustained in his side's midweek defeat against Nice.The other fixture in Group E on Tuesday sees Tottenham travel to CSKA Moscow.mp (AFP/SID)
