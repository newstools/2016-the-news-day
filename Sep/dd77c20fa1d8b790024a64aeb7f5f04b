GUINEA&#8230;&#8230;(1)1 ZIMBABWE&#8230;&#8230;0ZIMBABWE&#8217;S hopes of finishing the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign with a flourish ended rather disappointingly after they were beaten by Guinea in the searing heat of the Stade 28 Septembre in Conakry, Guinea yesterday. BY HENRY MHARA IN CONAKRY, GUINEA.It was perhaps the expected end to the encounter considering the shoddy traveling arrangement by the Warriors which saw them arriving in the West African nation just hours before kickoff.The trip initially looked doomed before a chartered plane was arranged for the team at the eleventh hour, touching down in the Guinea capital at around 3am after a punishing seven hour journey from Harare.As a result, the Warriors who went into this Group L match having already booked their ticket to the Gabon finals next January, appeared to be suffering from fatigue, playing with a slow tempo early on, allowing the hosts to have the ball while they defended deep in their own half.Guinea, who played the last four minutes of the match with a man down after substitute Alkany Bangoura was redcarded for punching Costa Nhamoinesu on 90th minute, got the only goal of the match on the half hour mark courtesy of Michel Landel after Knowledge Musona had missed a glorious chance to put the visitors ahead just moments earlier.The Khama Billiat=less Warriors, to their credit, dominated the second half, and had good chances to score at least a goal, but the closest they came in finding the equaliser was when Musona hit the upright on 52nd minute.Kalisto Pasuwa&#8217;s men pushed for a goal late on but the hosts held on for their second win of the campaign for a total seven points while the Warriors, who were looking for an unprecedented unbeaten run in the Afcon qualifiers, have 11 points. The team is expected back home this morning.Zimbabwe: T.Mukuruva, B Moyo, O Bhasera, C Nhamoinesu, L Mhlanga, W Katsande, M Nakamba, T Kutinyu (T Ndoro, 59&#8242;), E Rusike (R Chitiyo, 80&#8242;), K Musona, C Malajila
