BY REJOICE CHINGWARUThe London Fashion Week is held every February and for the past three years, it has involved 70 countries and over 550 international fashion designers showcasing their work in static exhibitions and installations.Charmaine Chitate from the British Council told NewsDay yesterday that the London Fashion Week offered designers an opportunity to showcase their fashion designs, as the event was a platform to develop networks in the United Kingdom s and international fashion sectors. The London Fashion Week will be a showcasing and networking platform for designers and they will gain exposure and business development opportunities for fashion organisations and emerging talent, she said. In 2017 IFS intends to announce a new theme, different from this year s Utopia theme, and each participating country will respond to it in a curatorial manner. Chitate said this year s theme was a celebration of the 500th anniversary of Thomas More s Utopia.She said IFS was open to designers within their first five years of industry experience and a number of applications were received before Sunday s deadline.
