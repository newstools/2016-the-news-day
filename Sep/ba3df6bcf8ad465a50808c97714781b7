JOHANNESBURG Kaizer Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela believes his team s three new foreign attackers will start delivering for the team once they have adapted to life at the South African top-flight football club. Goal.comZimbabwean attacking midfielders Edmore Chirambadare, Mitchell Katsvairo as well as Zambian striker Lewis Macha all joined Chiefs during the recently closed South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) transfer window period.The trio are yet to hit the back of the next for Amakhosi in a competitive match thus far in the new 2016/17 season as they patiently wait for their opportunities. They have only played two matches. One would have hoped that they would be given a bit of a chance, he told Mzansi Football. Adaptation is not easy for foreign players. The culture and the way of playing the game is very different here. From a technical point of view, in terms of their finishing, their technique, it&#8217;s tops. I think strikers are born with that natural instinct, but it takes time. Chirambadare was handed his Kaizer Chiefs debut but could not help his new team as they crashed out of the MTN Cup with a 1-0 loss to Cape Town City last month and went on to miss his team s 1-2 loss to Bidvest Wits in their opening match of the season.Chiefs will host Platinum Stars in a PSL game at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg.
