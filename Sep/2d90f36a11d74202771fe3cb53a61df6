The supervisory board of Lufthansa&nbsp;meeting Wednesday decided to let&nbsp;its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings rent 35&nbsp;aircraft currently operating under the banner of loss-making carrier Air Berlin. Another five&nbsp;Air Berlin planes are to go to Austrian Airlines.&nbsp;The agreement reached would&nbsp;be valid for six years, Lufthansa executives told reporters.The renting of Air Berlin planes&nbsp;will&nbsp;allow Lufthansa to bolster its low-cost offering, while letting Air Berlin reduce its fleet after failing to return profits amid increased competition in the budget aviation industry. Air Berlin announced Wednesday night it would also have to slash up to 1,200 jobs. It said the future focus would be on operating a smaller fleet of 75 aircraft at its hubs in Berlin and D sseldorf."It's hard for me to announce job cuts, but we simply have to reduce our workforce; we aim to do this in a socially responsible manner," Air Berlin CEO Stefan Pichler said in a statement.Air Berlin shareholder Etihad Airways is talking with travel company TUI about a possible combination of airline TUIfly and Air Berlin's Austrian subsidiary Niki. That plan would allow Air Berlin to dispose of over a dozen aircraft.Buying Brussels AirlinesSeparately, Lufthansa said Wednesday that it would take full ownership of Brussels Airlines.
