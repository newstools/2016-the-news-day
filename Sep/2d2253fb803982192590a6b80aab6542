Seven games played, six goals, three assists. The start of Thorgan Hazard's 2016-17 season has been nothing short of sensational. Against Werder Bremen on Matchday 3, Hazard displayed the kind of form that has Gladbach flying and comparisons with his brother Eden no longer in jest. Thorgan's story has been on the brink of making the headlines since he joined Gladbach on loan back in June 2015. After impressing in his first six months, he made the permanent move to the Bundesliga and unlike many Chelsea loanees, he hasn't looked back. Thorgan has replaced his raw, youthful talent with an incredible touch and grace to his play. His dribbling isn't as flashy as that of others, but thanks to an improved awareness, it's become more effective. As for his scoring, well it's become a regular part of Gladbach victories these days. In short, Thorgan Hazard has become an excellent player and this season it's clear for all to see. Of course, Thorgan has benefited from being in a team flooded with a fleet of flying attacking players who deliver sensational counter attacks. The decision to swap London for M nchengladbach permanently is not one that every youngster would make. Football though, is clearly what drives the 23-year-old. Hailing from a well-documented family of footballers - his parents played, as do his three other brothers - it is clear that Hazard has always wanted to play. Now, 83 games into his Gladbach career, it can't be long before both he and his brother Eden are tearing down the flanks of Belgium's Red Devils. There is a chance that Hazard will return to London - Chelsea possess the right to exercise a buy-back clause - and if his development continues, the Premier League is an inevitable destination. Right now though, both Gladbach and the Bundesliga fans are happy where he is. Watching his scintillating peformance against Werder Bremen, it is exactly where he should be.
