ZIMBABWE People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru will this weekend head to Matabeleland South province where she has lined up campaign rallies in Ntabazinduna and Gwanda on Friday and Saturday, respectively. BY SILAS NKALAZimbabwe People First leader Joice MujuruZimPF s head of communications, Methuseli Moyo, yesterday said Mujuru s rallies would go ahead despite the police s terrorism fears . We are hopeful our rallies will go ahead as planned, both in Gwanda and Ntabazinduna. We have held nine star rallies countrywide so far and they have all been peaceful, he said. There is no basis, therefore, for anyone to imagine otherwise. Preparations are at an advanced stage and we are expecting gold rallies. There is no terrorism at all. Zanu PF is terrified by rising tides of opposition forces and thinks that it is terrorism. It is competition. They better get used to it because it can only intensify. The bans are in bad faith and illegal. They must be reversed. Bulawayo police on Monday banned the People s Democratic Party s (PDP) first anniversary rally scheduled for White City Stadium on September 11, claiming they had received intelligence reports of looming terror attack that were circulated on social media platforms.Police then reversed the decision, describing the threats as a hoax.Police in Harare last week banned a joint political parties demonstration, organised under the banner of the National Electoral Reform Agenda (Nera), citing security concerns.The ban is now being contested at the High Court with PDP leader, Tendai Biti, who is representing Nera.
