RURAL Schools Library Trust s treasurer, Wilma Mutemasango-Sweeney, who is based in the United Kingdom, has been nominated for the International Women s Awards 2016 edition for the Community Champion award in recognition of her efforts in the construction and resourcing of a library at Chikowore Primary School. BY ARTS REPORTER Mutemasango-Sweeney said she had decided to construct the library after realising that a monetary donation would not accomplish much. I kept thinking about it and instead of just giving the money, I decided to build a library that will benefit more than a couple of children, who would receive funding, she said.New Zealand-based founder of the trust, Driden Kunaka, called on people to vote for Mutemasango-Sweeney following her nomination. Naturally, we are excited that the work by one of us is recognised through Wilma s nomination alongside other illustrious women of Zimbabwe, who have worked tirelessly to make a mark in various ways. The nomination embraces the trust s philosophy to empower the Zimbabwean rural child through provision of relevant reading material; it demonstrates the importance of libraries in usually marginalised communities, he said. It is my hope and belief that librarians, educationists, people with an interest libraries, reading and learning will demonstrate their appreciation of a good job well done by voting for Wilma in this competition. Voting is set to close on September 30 and winners in the various categories will be announced at a glamorous awards ceremony at the prestigious Athena in Leicester, United.
