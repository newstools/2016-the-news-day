A YOUTHFUL maskandi local group, Ezika Dibi, has vowed to use music to preserve African culture at a time many artistes are distancing themselves from the traditional music genre. BY SINDISO DUBEThe 11-member all-male group based in South Africa, where they specialise in maskandi, a genre common in Southern Africa, was in the country to promote their latest album, Umahlalegangeni. We sing about hope and our culture. Maskandi is a traditional genre that seeks to uplift our culture. Our music speaks to the inner person. It s about our roots, where we are headed as a people. We urge fellow youths to take charge of their culture and preserve it. As musicians, we do it through our music, Thabani Dibi Sibanda, the group s leader, said.The group s latest album, which was released in July, is a fusion of celebratory themes with songs like Highlanders, a praise song for the oldest local football team, Highlanders FC, Ngikuthandile, Uma Ujola and EmaNgunini.The group has made a mark in South Africa, where they have performed at the Africa Day celebrations, Khaya Arts Festival and the annual Dr Joshua Nkomo celebrations (South Africa), among other notable events.They have also shared the stage with Solly Moholo, Zinja Ziyamluma, Mlambos Express and Uboneni Magubane, among others. We will be holding more live shows to promote our recently released album. We have made it easier for fans, who want our music, because they can now get it at Marx Hardware in Bulawayo s central business district, Sibanda said.
