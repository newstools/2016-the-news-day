The German Federal Labor Agency (BA) said Thursday that the number of jobless Germans fell by 76,682 in September from August, with a total of 2.61 million people out of work.Correspondingly, the nominal unemployment rate declined from 6.1 percent to 5.9 percent - the lowest level since German reunification in October 1990."The demand for new employees continues to be high," said Labor Agency chief Frank-J rgen Weise, as the economy was driven by robust consumer spending and public investment related to the influx of migrants and Syrian war refugees.IHS economist Timo Klein said employment had been helped by migration from troubled eurozone countries and Eastern Europe. The influx of asylum seekers in 2015, primarily from the Mideast would "strengthen this tendency" in the next two years "as more and more obtain right of residence," he told the news agency AP.

The adjusted unemployment rate, however, remained at 6.1 percent, BA said.uhe/kd (AP, dpa, Reuters)&nbsp;
