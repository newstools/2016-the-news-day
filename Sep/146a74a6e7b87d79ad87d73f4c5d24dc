As part of his efforts to improve relations with the communist island nation of Cuba, US President Barack Obama has announced his choice for US ambassador to the Caribbean island. Jeffrey DeLaurentis has already served as the top, non-ambassadorial diplomat in Cuba since 2014, having completed two previous postings on the island. Since diplomatic relations were re-established between the two countries, DeLaurentis has led a series of talks with the Cuban government.Obama referred to the naming of an ambassador a "common-sense" and "vital" step in normalizing ties."Jeff's leadership has been vital throughout the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, and the appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries," Obama said in a statement, adding that having an ambassador in Cuba would also make it easier to advocate.Jeffrey DeLaurentis has been instrumental in improving ties between the US and Cuba"Having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests, and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government," he added.&nbsp;"We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador."Obama has&nbsp;increasingly relaxed&nbsp; decades-old prohibitions&nbsp;on commerce and travel with the&nbsp;island, with commercial flights reconnecting the Cold War enemies for the first time in decades. Both nations have also reopened their respective embassies. The US and Cuba had severed diplomatic ties in 1961. &nbsp;Opposition to nominationJeffrey DeLaurentis's posting still needs to be approved by the US Senate. It is unclear whether the Republican-controlled chamber will agree to Obama's nomination, as it has shown a great deal of opposition to the president's Cuba policy.A number of senators have argued that diplomatic outreach was not in the best interests of the US and have vowed to block any nomination for ambassador, adding that a lack of progress on democracy and human rights in Cuba were among their chief concerns. Texan Senator Ted Cruz and Floridian Senator Marco Rubio, who both have Cuban roots, have been particularly vocal in their opposition.Slow processObama and Raul Castro had begun the process of restoring diplomatic relations two years ago, however, a major trade embargo that can only be lifted by the US Congress remains in place.In March 2016, Obama became the first US president to&nbsp;visit Cuba since before World War II.ss/jm&nbsp;(dpa, AP)&nbsp;
