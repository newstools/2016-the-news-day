GOSPEL songstress, Jennifer Maneni launched her much-awaited DVD album titled His Grace on Friday, with its first copy being auctioned for $600. BY TAWANDA TADERERAJennifer ManeniAlthough the album carries 10 tracks, Maneni only did videos for five songs Wakatendeka, Ndomutenda, You Raise Me Up, Hamunyare and Inyasha Kurarama.The DVD album is laden with well-thought out concepts and superb image quality that could see Maneni hitting the right chords in a genre synonymous with poor quality productions.Speaking to NewsDay on the sidelines of the launch, Maneni said she was overwhelmed by the success of the event, which she said went beyond her expectations. I am happy with the success of the launch. The attendance was beyond my expectations. I have been receiving positive comments about my performance, which is something encouraging to keep on working hard, she said. Maneni said she would be releasing more videos.The 27-year-old singer has been making great strides in the music industry and to date, she has worked with various groups, among them Mapostori, on a track called Buruka Mweya Washe and CCAP Voice of Sakubva, on a track called Yahweh.
