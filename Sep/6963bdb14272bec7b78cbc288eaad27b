PREPARATIONS for this year s edition of the Pfumvudza Arts Festival are at an advanced stage, with a number of participants from different art disciplines expected to converge in Marondera for the event, which will be held at Pagomo Leisure Garden on September 16. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA The event, whose inaugural edition received overwhelming support last year, will be held under the theme Reaching out for Global Partnership for the Arts and no to Poverty through Arts.Festival director, Ronald Badza told NewsDay yesterday that this year s edition would be a one-day event due to limited financial resources. The inaugural festival was a three-day event because we had sponsors from the United States. However, this year, it is a different thing. It is a one-day event due to financial problems. But we made sure that all disciplines are well-represented like before, he said. We have a number of exhibitors, who have registered to take part. There will be a variety of activities from cultural dances, presentations and performances from local groups. The main objective of the festival is to promote art as a means of sustainable livelihood due to the increased level of unemployment. We can reduce poverty through art by witnessing talented youths doing what they know best. Badza said they were honoured to have two primary schools from Murewa, which were going to display their traditional dance skills. We are still working on a guest artiste to spice up the festival and we hope by Monday, we would have secured one, he said.The event is a platform created by Revival Arts Trust, a registered organisation aimed at promoting arts and culture activities based in Marondera.
