Should the West take military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the Russian forces supporting him? Middle East expert Udo Steinbach makes the case for just such a course of action. Moscow has yet to give up on a political settlement to the conflict in Syria, a Kremlin spokesperson says. Amid escalating violence in Aleppo, the US and UK have accused Russia of possible war crimes. (26.09.2016) Rebels have retaliated by closing water pumps for government-held areas of Aleppo, affecting 1.5 million people. The UN has called on all parties to "stop attacks on water infrastructure," considered a war crime. (24.09.2016) Syria's armed forces have called on civilians in Aleppo to flee rebel-held areas ahead of a ground offensive. The country has witnessed an escalation of violence in the wake of a nationwide "cessation of hostilities." (23.09.2016) The UK and France have accused Russia of possible war crimes as the Syrian army-led offensive entered its fourth day. Thousands of civilians remain trapped in Aleppo amid a brutal campaign to uproot rebels in the city. (26.09.2016) The city's dire humanitarian crisis has been compounded by government shelling in the rebel-held east. On top of the hospital attack, Human Rights Watch has accused President Assad of using banned chemical weapons. (28.09.2016) US&nbsp;Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday threatened to end Washington's engagement with Russia in Syria following a brutal regime offensive against rebels in Aleppo."He informed the foreign minister that the United States is making preparations to suspend US-Russia bilateral engagement on Syria unless Russia takes immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo and restore the cessation of hostilities," said US State Department spokesman John Kirby.Kerry "made clear the United States and its partners hold Russia responsible for this situation, including the use of incendiary and bunker buster bombs in an urban environment, a drastic escalation that puts civilians at risk," Kirby added.&nbsp;The US' top diplomat&nbsp;made Washington's intentions clear in a telephone call with&nbsp;his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, according to the State Department.More than 250 people have died since government forces backed by Russian airstrikes launched a vicious campaign last week to retake rebel-held&nbsp;eastern Aleppo, according to figures from independent war monitors.

Denying people access to essential health care violates international humanitarian law."Earlier Wednesday, airstrikes and shelling destroyed two out of the eight remaining hospitals in rebel-held Aleppo.Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he would put forward a UN Security Council resolution to establish a ceasefire in Aleppo."At this very moment, we are proposing to discuss a resolution to obtain a ceasefire in Aleppo," Ayrault told French lawmakers."This resolution will leave everyone facing their responsibilities: Those who don't vote for it, risk being held responsible for complicity in war crimes," the French foreign minister added.London and Washington last week accused Russia of possibly committing war crimes in Aleppo, allegations which Moscow vehemently denies.More than 300,000 people have been killed and half the population displaced since the conflict erupted in 2011, when government forces launched a bloody crackdown on peaceful protesters calling for President Bashar al-Assad to stepdown.
