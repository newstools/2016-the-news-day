THE Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has entered into an agreement with the Grain and Oilseeds Traders Association to contract maize, soya and wheat farming worth nearly $200 million. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAIn an interview with NewsDay yesterday, GMAZ chairperson, Tafadzwa Musarara said the private sector has agreed to enter into contract farming to complement government efforts in the command agriculture initiative.Musarara said the contract farming initiative would see the private sector contracting 100 000 hectares of soya beans and maize and 45 000ha for wheat, which is expected to cost $188m. We are doing contract farming, but this time, the size has been multiplied three times and this is the highest production since 2007, he said.According to the agreement, GMAZ and Grain and Oilseeds Traders Association of Zimbabwe committed to do contract farming of soya beans and maize in all traditional farming districts across the country of 100 000ha for summer farming season of 2016-17.They also committed to undertake contract farming of wheat in all traditional farming districts across the country of 45 000ha for the winter season.The agreement said in order to achieve the targets, private players requested for government intervention and raised the need to import fertilisers, particularly ammonium nitrate and urea, as local fertiliser manufacturing companies had no capacity to provide adequate supplies.The parties said the fertiliser manufacturers carrying stock of 10 000 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate was inadequate, as demand was 150 000 metric tonnes. We appeal that fertiliser importing companies be allowed to import without limitation in order to provide for both summer and local winter farming, the statement reads in part.Private sector players want contracted farms to be protected against illegal settlements or invasions, as was the case with dairy farms. They also want the government to provide a guarantee to the contractor of uninterrupted stay and tenure at the farm for a contract period of five years and more, where capital investment was involved.As part of the agreement, the private sector urged the government to ban the importation of imported finished products such as maize meal, wheat flour, maize grits and soya meal in order to create a secure market for the produce grown under contract farming.The government has embarked on a command agriculture programme, where it aims to produce two million tonnes of maize from 400 000 hectares of land, as part of efforts to mitigate drought.
