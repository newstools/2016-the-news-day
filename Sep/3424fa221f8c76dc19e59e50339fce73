A TOP health official has said the Midlands province missed its voluntary male circumcision targets in the third quarter of this year, with 14 335 men undergoing surgery against a target of 19 386 circumcisions. By Stephen Chadenga The province had a target of 19 386, but the total number of men circumcised in the third quarter was 14 335, which is an achievement of 74 %, Midlands provincial monitoring and evaluation officer, Tuso Tanda, told stakeholders at a National Aids Council meeting held in Gweru recently.He said Gweru and Mberengwa had the highest number of men circumcised, while Chirumanzu and Shurugwi recorded the lowest. The province failed to achieve its targets. However, Gweru and Mberengwa were exceptional, performing above their district targets achieving 132% and 220%, respectively, Tanda said.He said although the implementation of the Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) had greatly improved compared to the first and second quarters of 2016, the implementation of the programme was being affected by the shortage of vehicles for outreach activities.In 2009, the government adopted male circumcision as one of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies, amid reports that circumcision reduces transmission of the HIV by up to 60%.Besides reportedly reducing chances of men acquiring HIV by 60%, VMMC also reduces the risk of cancer on male sexual reproductive organs, urinary tract infections in young boys, prevention of sexually transmitted illnesses and also assisting in reducing cervical cancer in female partners.Government is targeting circumcising 1,3 million males by 2017.
